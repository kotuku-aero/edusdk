# CanFly SDK
Kotuku Engine data SDK

This respository holds the files necessary to start development using Kotuku CanFly products.

The repository is a subset of the private development branch for Kotuku devices.

## EDU

The EDU id's and types are defined here.  These are subject to change, as ID's are added they will be added once testing is complete.

## Alarms

The CabFlyID.def file defines alarams.  These are fully programmable in the CanFly devices and this file only shows the alarms that re pre-defined.  The owner of the device can use the CanFly Commander application to change, add or delete alarms.  Any implementor needs to be aware of this.
